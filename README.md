# PowerShellWordle

## Overview

This project is recreating Wordle in the command line using PowerShell. The goal of the project is just to learn and practice PowerShell.

Wordle is a word game in which the user attempts to guess a random word. The game will indicate which letters the user has correct and the user will continue to guess until they land on the correct word. [Official Wordle website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## Design

Design description.

### MVP

I expect the user to be able to run a command to start the game. The script will generate a random 5 letter word which the user will attempt to guess. The game will tell the user which letters they have correct, if any, and whether they are in the correct position. The game will continue until the user guesses the word correctly and will tell the user how many attempts it took for them to win.
